# Wooden Fish Knock Knock (React Ver.)

### Description

A small project for me to try something new (Bun, Zustand, Howler.js, Framer Motion, etc.).
You can knock on wooden fish (or replace to your boss's head!) to calm yourself down.
There's a version of this project developed with Vue: [Wooden Fish Knock Knock (Vue Ver.)](https://github.com/unicornGL/wooden-fish-knock-knock-vue-ver)
